# MVCPractise

## Hello! This is my application where I trained skills of using MVC pattern.

### In this app you can find the most popular games in Steam, their price, rating. Favorite games you can add to the separate array, and see them by clicking on the "Favorite games" button.

### The following additions were used:

#### label animation
#### scroll view, tabel view
#### button animation
#### ability to delete table cells in Favorite games
#### search in table views
#### UITapGestureRecognizer

UI elements were created by Storyboard and by code.

On the start screen you can see the Stalker image. You should tap on the screen to go to the genre selection screen:
